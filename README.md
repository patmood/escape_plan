# Escape Plan

Work out the furthest possible distance you can travel for a given budget

## TODO
- Parse airport csv once and serialize/save object
- Calculate distance to every airport from a given location
- Sort by distance
- Implement binary search to find best destination
- Integrate into express app
- Use wego api (or other) to fetch prices http://www.wego.com/api/flights/docs#api_startSearch
- Get binary search working for prices
- Make it look sexy
